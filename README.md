# Smart Traffic Rule Enforcement System ðŸš¦

## Project Description
This project is a prototype developed during a hackathon.  
It aims to detect **unauthorized billboards** placed on streets and provide a way to report such violations.  
Unauthorized billboards can create safety hazards, distract drivers, and spoil the cityâ€™s planned structure.  

Our system is designed to support smarter cities by ensuring that billboards follow proper rules and regulations.  
By detecting and flagging unauthorized placements, this project contributes to **road safety, better city planning, and rule enforcement**.
